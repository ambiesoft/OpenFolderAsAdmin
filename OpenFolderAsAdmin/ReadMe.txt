Name: OpenFolderAsAdmin
Environment: Windows XP or later

OpenFolderAsAdmin opens explorer with higer priviledge, in fact it is not an explorer
but an Fileopendialog, still it can almost satisfy user request they want the explorer to do.

Launching an explorer with higer privilege is difficult in windows, but there is a time a user want to do it.
For example, The user want to launch an archiver to compress a folder from a context menu but it needs higher
privilege to complete a task. An archiver launched from this software also has higher privilege and the task can be
completed.
